2. Pepperoni Pizza
Ingredients:

    Pizza Dough:
        (Same as Margherita Pizza)

    Toppings:
        1 cup tomato sauce
        2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
        1 cup sliced pepperoni
        1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
        1/2 teaspoon dried basil
        1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)

Instructions:

    Prepare the Dough:
        Follow the same steps as the Margherita Pizza dough preparation.

    Prepare the Pizza:
        Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C).
        Punch down the dough and divide it into two equal pieces. Roll each piece into a circle on a floured surface.
        Place the rolled-out dough on a pizza stone or baking sheet.
        Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.
        Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.
        Arrange the pepperoni slices evenly over the cheese.
        Sprinkle the dried oregano, dried basil, and red pepper flakes (if using) over the top.

    Bake and Serve:
        Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
        Remove from the oven, slice, and enjoy!
