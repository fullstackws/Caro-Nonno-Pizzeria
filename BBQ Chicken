3. BBQ Chicken Pizza
Ingredients:

    Pizza Dough:
        (Same as Margherita Pizza)

    Toppings:
        1 cup BBQ sauce
        2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
        1 cup cooked chicken breast, shredded
        1/2 red onion, thinly sliced
        1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
        1/2 cup shredded spicy Gouda cheese (optional)
        Olive oil for brushing.

Instructions:

    Prepare the Dough:
        Follow the same steps as the Margherita Pizza dough preparation.

    Prepare the Pizza:
        Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C).
        Punch down the dough and divide it into two equal pieces. Roll each piece into a circle on a floured surface.
        Place the rolled-out dough on a pizza stone or baking sheet.
        Spread the BBQ sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.
        Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.
        Distribute the shredded chicken and red onion slices evenly over the cheese.
        If using, sprinkle the shredded spicy Gouda cheese on top.

    Bake and Serve:
        Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
        Remove from the oven, sprinkle with chopped cilantro, and brush the crust with olive oil.
        Slice and enjoy it with friends or your dog!
