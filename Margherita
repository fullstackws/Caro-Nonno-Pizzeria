1. Margherita Pizza
Ingredients:

    Pizza Dough:
        2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
        1 1/2 cups warm water (110°F)
        4 cups all-purpose flour
        1 1/2 teaspoon sugar
        2 teaspoons salt
        2 tablespoons olive oil

    Toppings:
        1 cup tomato sauce
        2 cups fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced
        1/4 cup fresh basil leaves
        2 tablespoons olive oil
        Salt to taste
       

Instructions:

    Prepare the Dough:
        In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water and let it sit for about 5 minutes until foamy.
        In a large bowl, mix the flour, sugar and salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Stir until a dough forms.
        Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
        Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours or until doubled in size.
    Prepare the Pizza:
        Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C).
        Punch down the dough and divide it into two equal pieces. Roll each piece into a circle on a floured surface.
        Place the rolled-out dough on a pizza stone or baking sheet.
        Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.
        Arrange the mozzarella slices on top.
    Bake and Serve:
        Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
        Remove from the oven, drizzle with olive oil, and scatter fresh basil leaves on top.
        Slice and enjoy!
